## DispersionReticle
Updated and completely reworked mod that adds additional circle displaying fully focused dispersion of a gun.

Original idea by **StranikS_Scan**, completely reworked by me.

## Features
- shows additional reticle displaying fully focused dispersion of a gun
- works well with "Use server reticle" option from game settings
- works well in replays
- (DispersionReticle_server_reticle) display both client and server reticles with "Use server reticle" option

## Resource
- [WGMods](https://wgmods.net/5251/)
- [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/worldoftanks/wot-mods/dispersionreticle-reworked)
- [Github Releases Page](https://github.com/Pruszko/DispersionReticle/releases)

## Installation
For vanilla behavior with gun dispersion (adds dispersion reticle to client/server reticle):
- Copy "DispersionReticle.wotmod" file into "[WoT game directory]/mods/[version]/" directory

For both client and server crosshair with gun dispersion:
- Copy "DispersionReticle_server_reticle.wotmod" file into "[WoT game directory]/mods/[version]/" directory

Note: Choose *ONLY ONE* of them

## Compatibility
This mod **IS NOT** compatible with mods adding **client+server marker** at once.

Use "DispersionReticle_server_reticle.wotmod" for similar functionality instead.

However, it should be compatible with any crosshair mods that changes how crosshair or reticle looks like.
