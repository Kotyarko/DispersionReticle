## DispersionReticle
Updated and completely reworked mod that adds additional circle displaying fully focused dispersion of a gun.

Original idea by **StranikS_Scan**, completely reworked by me.

## Features
- shows additional reticle displaying fully focused dispersion of a gun
- works well with "Use server reticle" option from game settings
- works well in replays

## Resource
- [WGMods](https://wgmods.net/5251/)
- [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/worldoftanks/wot-mods/dispersionreticle-reworked)
- [Github Releases Page](https://github.com/Pruszko/DispersionReticle/releases)

## Installation
Download "DispersionReticle.wotmod" file and place it into "[WoT game directory]/mods/1.11.0.0/" directory

## Compatibility
Mod should be compatible with any crosshair mods that changes how crosshair or reticle looks like, however **it is not compatible with mod displaying both client and server reticles.**

In the future, I'll add an additional version (or functionality) that will cooperate with dispersion reticle.
