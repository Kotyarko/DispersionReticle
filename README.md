## DispersionReticle
Updated and completely reworked mod that adds additional circle displaying fully focused dispersion of a gun.

Original idea by **StranikS_Scan**, completely reworked by me.

## Features
**DispersionReticle**:
- closest to vanilla behavior
- shows additional reticle displaying fully focused dispersion of a gun
- works well with "Use server reticle" option from game settings
- works well in replays

**DispersionReticle_server**:
- always shows client reticle only (without dispersion reticle)
- **"Use server reticle"** option additionally shows server reticle

**DispersionReticle_all**:
- combines features of **DispersionReticle** and **DispersionReticle_server**

- [Github Releases Page](https://github.com/Pruszko/DispersionReticle/releases)

## Installation
For vanilla behavior with gun dispersion (adds dispersion reticle to client/server reticle):
- Copy "DispersionReticle.wotmod" file into "[WoT game directory]/mods/[version]/" directory

For both client and server crosshair only:
- Copy "DispersionReticle_server.wotmod" file into "[WoT game directory]/mods/[version]/" directory

For both client and server crosshair with gun dispersion:
- Copy "DispersionReticle_all.wotmod" file into "[WoT game directory]/mods/[version]/" directory

Note: Choose **ONLY ONE** of them

## Compatibility
This mod **IS NOT** compatible with mods adding **client+server marker** at once.

Use "DispersionReticle_server.wotmod" or "DispersionReticle_all.wotmod" for
similar functionality instead.

However, it should be compatible with any crosshair mods that changes
how crosshair or reticle looks like.
